	// *********** Properties of "Tree" Data Structure ******8
	
	//1. Used to represent data in hierarchical form
	//2. Every node has two components (Data and Reference to it's sub-category)
	//3. It has a root node/Base node and two disjoint binary tree called left-subtree and right-sub trree
	
	
	// ******* Some Terminologies of the tree ********
	// Very Easy Do them yourself...
	//1. Root
	//2. child
	//3. parent
	//4. depth of tree
	//5. depth of node
	//6. height of tree
	//7. height of node
	//8. predecessor
	//8. successsor
	
	
	// ***************** What is Binary Tree **********************
	//1.  A tree is called as binary tree, if each node has zero, one or two child.
	//2. It is a family of Data STructure(BST, Heap tree, AVL, Red-Black tree, Syntax Tree, Huffman coding tree etc.
	
	
	
	// ****************** Why Should we learn Binary Tree *****************88
	//1. Prerequirte for more advanced trees (mentioned above)
	//2. It is used in solving specific problems:
		// HUffman coding tree
		// Heap(priority Queue)
		// Expression Parsing
	
	
	
	
	
	// **************** Types of Binary Tree *************************
	// 1. Strict Binary Tree: If each node has either 2 chidren or none;
	// 2. Full Binary Tree: if each non leaf nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at same level
	//3. Complete Binary Tree: if all levels are completely  filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all the keys as left as possible.
	
	
	// *************** Tree Representation using Array *******************
	// Left Child will be stored at a[2x] where  x is the index of parent node
	// right child will be stored at a[2x+1] where x is the index of prent node;
