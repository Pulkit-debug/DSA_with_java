	// *******************WHAT IS DIVIDE AND CONQUER
	
	// Divide and Conquer is an algorithm design paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into 
	// subproblems of similar type. until these become simple enough to solve directly. The solutions to the subProblems
	// are then combined to give a solution to the origina problem.
	
	// *****EXAMPLE
	// 	1. Software Development by modules.
	
	
	
	// ************ PROPERTY OF D&C ALGO
	
	// Optimal Structure:
			// Any problem has optimal structure property if its overall optimal solution can be constructred from the optimal solution of it's subproblem
	
		// Example: Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
	
	
	// ********** Why Learn DIVIDE AND CONQUER
		// Divide and conquer is most effective when problem has 'optimal structure' property
	
	// Some Example Questions/topic to solve with D & Q
	//1. Merge Sort
	//2. quick Sort
	//3. Binary Search
	//4. Fibonacchi Series
	//5. Number Factors
	//6. House Thief
	//7. Edit Distance
	//8. Zero/One Knapsack
	//9. Longest common subsequence
	//10. Longest palindromic Subsequence
	//11. Longest palindromic substring
	//12. Min Cost to reach last cell
	//13. Num of paths to last cell
