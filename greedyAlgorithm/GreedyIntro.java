	// ******What is Greedy Algorithm???
	
	// Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece.
	
	// It always chooses the next piece if offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
	
	// Greedy fits perfectly for those solutions in which choosing a locally optimal solution also leads to globally solution (aka 'Greedy choice')
	

	// **********Why learn Greedy Algo???
	
	//Solution: Because some problem (following 'Greedy Choice' property) can be best solved using Greedy Algo.
	
	
	// ************ common Greedy algorithms....
	
	//1. Insertion sort
	//2. Selection sort
	//3. Topological sort
	//4. prims
	//5. Krushal
	
	
	// Activity Selection Problem
	// Coin Change Problem
	// Fractional Knapsack
